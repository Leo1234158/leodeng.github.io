  <h1>Bio</h1>

  <p>Leo Deng is a Chinese artist currently living and working in Australia. His practice explores the tension between structure, collapse, and control through woodworking, digital fabrication, lo-fi construction, and material experimentation.</p>

  <p>Influenced by artists from socialist and post-socialist contexts, Leo’s work reflects how built forms embody history, power, and ideology. His cross-cultural background further informs his approach to form, labor, and technology.</p>
