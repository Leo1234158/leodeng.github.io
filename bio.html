  <h1>Bio</h1>
  <p>Leo Deng is a Chinese artist currently living and working in Australia. His practice explores the tension between structure, collapse, and control through woodworking, digital fabrication, lo-fi construction, and material experimentation.</p>

  <p>Influenced by artists from socialist and post-socialist contexts, Leo’s work reflects how built forms embody history, power, and ideology. He often draws on cross-cultural experiences to examine how forms persist or dissolve under pressure.</p>
